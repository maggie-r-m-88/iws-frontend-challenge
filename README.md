# IWS-frontend-challenge

* When the config was set to test.mosquitto.org, the server was not sending me any responses. So, I am using a different broker for testing:
broker.emqx.io. Once I updated the host, everything seemed to work as expected.

* I used https://www.icetoolkit.com/Fourto20 as a reference for my calculations

* For a visual reference of the input/output reading I used https://www.sensorsone.com/measurement-to-linear-4-20ma-converter/
